## Visualizing Heart Development from 3D Volumetric images

Goal: Create an online interactive visualization platform for time-lapse 3D heart development (Heart and adjacent progenitor field) where quantitative data of cell morphology, stress patterns, genetic lineages and RNA-seq experiments can be plotted on their time and spatial positions and stored.
The website would be itself a resource for cardiac  research in constant construction as labs discover and add new data.

## Problems aimed to be solved 

#### Problems within the heart development field:

- There is still no technical way to perform time lapse imaging of heart development (the heart and other structures involved in the construction of the heart). Only snapshots of the structures can be acquired.

- When performing experiments a lot of information is lost: The real structure, position and 3D shapes are lost during the technical manipulation, which makes interpretation difficult. 

- In mouse heart development there’s no universal browser or staging method established yet as is the case with other model organisms such as c.elegans or drosophila: Creation of a generic platform for visualization, allowing the labs in Heart dev bio to upload their data.

- Resource for precise heart development 3D volumetric images. 


#### Problems for non-academic people:

- Resource for education to non expert audience

- Attract more interests from other fields outside biology such as engineering, architecture, physics, computer science to make them work in biomedical field.


## Current Users

- [Paul Villoutreix's lab](https://bioml.lis-lab.fr/) at LIS (Laboratoire d'Informatique et Systèmes)
- [Robert G. Kelly's lab](http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/equipe/genetic-control-of-heart-development/) at IBDM (Institut de Biologie du Dévelopement de Marseille)
within 
Both labs forming part of the interdisciplinary project of The Turing Centre for Living Systems [CENTURI](https://centuri-livingsystems.org/)


## Future users profiles

- Research teams in developmental biology. You will be able to visualize and download the data, graphics and animations.
- Researchers working in the field of gastruloids/organoids. You will have all the information about how the heart is built during development.
- Bioengineers wanting to create/print scaffolds and biomaterials with correct measurements of cardiac structures
- Medical doctors that study congenital heart diseases.
- 3D scientifc animators and illustrators. You will no longer have to sculpt the 3D objects from scratch based on drawings or pictures, the 3D meshes are made from microscopy data and available.
